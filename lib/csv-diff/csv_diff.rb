# This library performs diffs of flat file content that contains structured data
# in fields, with rows provided in a parent-child format.
#
# Parent-child data does not lend itself well to standard text diffs, as small
# changes in the organisation of the tree at an upper level (e.g. re-ordering of
# two ancestor nodes) can lead to big movements in the position of descendant
# records - particularly when the parent-child data is generated by a hierarchy
# traversal.
#
# Additionally, simple line-based diffs can identify that a line has changed,
# but not which field(s) in the line have changed.
#
# Data may be supplied in the form of CSV files, or as an array of arrays. The
# diff process process provides a fine level of control over what to diff, and
# can optionally ignore certain types of changes (e.g. changes in order).
